// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const requirementAnalysis = 'Gather all the data like what the customer wants to build, who will be the end user, and what is the objective of the product.'

const design = 'Finalize the software requirement specification (SRS document) from previous phases in the form of a system design specification document. A design phase in software development can include multiple deliverable documents for better communication and collaboration between different design and development teams.'

const implementation = 'The software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented.'

const testingAndIntegration = 'The developed software is tested thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed. Retesting, regression testing is done until the point at which the software is as per the customers expectation.'

const maintenance = 'After the deployment of a product on the production environment, maintenance of the product (i.e. if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be don) is taken care of by the developers.'
